This is the source repository for ByteFF-Pol.

* [ByteFF-Pol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575) is a polarizable force field parameterized by a graph neural network (GNN), trained on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data, thus eliminating the need for experimental calibration. ByteFF-Pol achieves exceptional accuracy in predicting the thermodynamic and transport properties of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming SOTA traditional and ML force fields.

## News
[2025/08/25]🔥We release ByteFF-Pol.


## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Python version >= 3.11

### Python Dependencies
All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. To install them, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Installing Gromacs
Download Gromacs from [official website](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/download.html).
```
wget https://ftp.gromacs.org/gromacs/gromacs-2025.3.tar.gz
```

To install Gromacs, please refer to the [official documentation](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html).
```
tar xfz gromacs-2025.3.tar.gz
cd gromacs-2025.3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON
make
make check
sudo make install
source /usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC
```

### Installing OpenMM for ByteFF2

To run **ByteFF2**, you need a customized version of [**OpenMM**](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) and [**OpenMM-VelocityVerlet**](https://github.com/z-gong/openmm-velocityVerlet).

1. Navigate to the `submodules/openmm` directory:
   ```bash
   cd submodules/openmm
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh [OPENMM_DIR]
   ```
   - `[OPENMM_DIR]` (optional): Installation path for OpenMM.
   - Default installation path is:
     ```
     /usr/local/openmm
     ```

3. The script will:
   - Compile and install the patched `openmm` (v8.3.1)
   - Compile and install `openmm-velocityVerlet`
   - Add required environment variables (`OPENMM_DIR` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) to your `~/.bashrc`

4. After installation, restart your terminal or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

After successful installation, you should see:
```
Success: Installed OpenMM and openmm-velocityVerlet.
```
**My note:** I was having a lot of issues with the installation of their custom `openmm-velocityVerlet` library across MacOS and linux on two different HPCs with different machine configurations and environments. While I finally got `openmm-velocityVerlet` to install using pip, it would throw a segmentation error with the installation. Please note that `openmm-velocityVerlet` is only used for non-equilibrium MD run for viscosity calculations, so if you are interested in getting viscosity of electrolytes, this installation can be skipped. I have made several changes in this codebase to improve functionality and make it as generic as possible.

### Trained Models
The model and configuration file are available on HuggingFace [byteff2](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/byteff2).

To download the model and configuration file, run:
```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download ByteDance-Seed/byteff2 --local-dir byteff2
```

## Quick Start
You can refer to several examples in the · directory; more details are available in the README.md file for each example.

* `example/1_training` contains scripts for training ByteFF-Pol.
* `example/2_compare_qm` contains scripts to compare QM and FF energies.
* `example/3_write_params` contains scripts to generate force field parameters using trained ByteFF-Pol model.
* `example/4_MD_simulations` contains scripts for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using ByteFF-Pol.
* `example/5_similarity` contains scripts for similarity analysis using ByteFF-Pol.

## Run Tests
You can verify the environments by running the tests:
```
make test
```
